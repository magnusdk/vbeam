) -> Array:
    """Apply a binary operation to two arrays, where the second array is potentially
    broadcasted and transposed to match the shape and axis-ordering of the first array.

    Args:
        a: The main array.
        b: The second array with potentially fewer axes than ``a``.
        binary_operation: A function that takes two arrays of the same shape and
            returns an array of the same shape.
        axes: The axes of `a` that corresponds to the axes of `b`.

    Let's say we have two arrays, ``a`` and ``b``. They share a dimension, in this
    case, the first dimension of ``b`` corresponds to the second dimension of ``a``:

    >>> dim0, dim1, dim2 = 2, 3, 4
    >>> a = np.ones([dim0, dim1, dim2])
    >>> b = np.ones([dim1])

    Now we want to add the arrays together, but ``a+b`` would raise an error since they
    are not broadcastable. With :func:`apply_binary_operation_across_axes` we can
    specify which axes of ``b`` should be used when applying the binary operation:

    >>> import operator
    >>> result = apply_binary_operation_across_axes(a, b, operator.add, [1])
    >>> result.shape
    (2, 3, 4)

    It also automatically transposes ``b`` to match the axis ordering of ``a``:

    >>> a = np.ones([dim0, dim1, dim2]) # <- dim2 comes AFTER dim1 in a!
    >>> b = np.ones([dim2, dim1])       # <- dim2 comes BEFORE dim1 in b!
    >>> result = apply_binary_operation_across_axes(a, b, operator.add, [2, 1])
    >>> result.shape
    (2, 3, 4)
