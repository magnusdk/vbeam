    """
    Calculate and return the apodization values based on the provided arguments
    (``sender``, ``point_position``, ``receiver``, and ``wave_data``).

    The ``dimensions`` argument determines what dimensions to keep; all others are
    summed over (except when ``dimesions`` is None where we keep all dimensions
    instead). ``spec`` describes the dimensions of the data. E.g., if ``dimensions`` is
    ``["transmits", "x", "z"]``, the result will be a 3D array with shape (Nt, Nx, Nz),
    where Nt, Nx, Nz are the sizes of the given dimensions in the data.

    Args:
        apodization (Apodization): The apodization function to use.
        sender (ElementGeometry): The sender argument to ``apodization``.
        point_position (np.ndarray): The point_position argument to ``apodization``.
        receiver (ElementGeometry): The receiver argument to ``apodization``.
        wave_data (WaveData): The wave data argument to ``apodization``.
        spec (Spec): A spec describing the dimensions/shape of the arguments.
        dimensions (Optional[Sequence[str]]): The dimensions to keep in the returned
            result. If it is an empty list, all dimensions are summed over. If it is
            None, all dimensions from the spec are kept.
        average (bool): If True, the result is averaged instead of summed.
        jit (bool): If True, the process is JIT-compiled (if the backend supports it).

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: The calculated apodization values with shape corresponding to the
        dimensions defined in ``dimensions``.
